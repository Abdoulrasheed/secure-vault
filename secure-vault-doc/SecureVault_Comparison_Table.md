# **Comparison of SecureVault with Similar Projects/Technologies**

The table below compares SecureVault with similar projects and technologies, highlighting its strengths, limitations, and key differentiators.

|  Technology/Project |  Purpose |  Limitations |  Comparison with SecureVault |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| TLS/SSL | Encrypts data in transit between client and server. | \- Stops encryption at Load Balancer or Proxy layer.\- No protection at application process level. | \- Complements TLS/SSL by adding application-level encryption.\- Adds bot detection and device identification. |
| mTLS (Mutual TLS) | Adds client-side certificate authentication on top of TLS. | \- Complex certificate management.\- Encryption stops at Proxy or Load Balancer or Within the server (data is decrypted before it gets into the process) | \- Easier integration without certificate infrastructure.\- Extends encryption to the application process. |
| FingerprintJS | Device fingerprinting for bot detection and fraud prevention. | \- Browser-focused; limited server-side support.\- No cryptographic challenge-response. | \- Cross-platform support (frontend and backend).\- Adds cryptographic challenge-response. |
| Cloudflare Bot Management | Protects applications from automated attacks and bots. | \- Requires traffic to pass through Cloudflareâ€™s network.\- Limited control for developers. | \- Self-hosted with full control.\- Adds device locking and cryptographic responses. |
| OAuth2 with PKCE | Secure authentication for public clients using cryptographic secrets. | \- Limited to authentication flows.\- No device-specific security or bot detection. | \- Encrypts all requests, not just authentication flows.\- Includes bot detection and device fingerprinting. |
| WebAuthn | Passwordless authentication using public-key cryptography. | \- Limited to authentication, not general request encryption.\- Encryption ends after initial authentication. | \- Extends encryption to all requests and responses.\- Adds bot detection and device-locking features. |
