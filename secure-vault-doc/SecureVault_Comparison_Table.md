**Comparison of SecureVault with Similar Projects/Technologies**  
The table below compares SecureVault with similar projects and technologies, highlighting its strengths, limitations, and key differentiators based on its updated focus: End-to-End Encryption, Device Fingerprinting, and Bot Detection.

| Technology/Project | Purpose | Limitations | Comparison with SecureVault |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| TLS/SSL | Encrypts data in transit between client and server. |- Encryption stops at Load Balancer or Proxy or the server (depeding on where termination happens and whether or not the data is re-encrypted by intermediaries). <br>- No device-specific security or bot detection. | - Complements TLS/SSL by encrypting requests to the application process. <br>- Adds device fingerprinting and bot detection. |
| mTLS (Mutual TLS) | Adds client-side certificate authentication on top of TLS. | <br>- Complex certificate management. <br> - Encryption stops at Proxy or Load Balancer. <br>- No device fingerprinting or bot detection. | \- Complements mTLS by extending encryption to the application process.<br>\- Adds device fingerprinting and bot detection without certificates. |
| FingerprintJS | Device fingerprinting for bot detection and fraud prevention. | \- Limited to browser environments.<br>\- No encryption or server-side support. | \- Provides cross-platform device fingerprinting (frontend and backend).<br>\- Combines fingerprinting with encryption and bot detection. |
| Cloudflare Bot Management | Protects applications from automated attacks and bots. | \- Requires traffic to route through Cloudflare.<br>\- Limited device-specific controls. \- Paid Service | \- Fully self-hosted with complete control over bot detection. <br> -Adds E2E encryption and device locking. |
| OAuth2 with PKCE | Secure authentication for public clients using cryptographic secrets. | \- Limited to authentication flows.<br>\- No encryption for general requests.<br>\- No bot detection or device-specific security. | \- Encrypts all requests and responses, not just authentication flows.<br>\- Includes bot detection and device fingerprinting. |
| WebAuthn | Passwordless authentication using public-key cryptography. | \- Limited to authentication use cases.<br>\- No E2E encryption for all requests.<br>\- No bot detection or fingerprinting. | <br>- Extends encryption beyond authentication.  <br>-Adds bot detection and device locking. |
