**Comparison of SecureVault with Similar Projects/Technologies**  
The table below compares SecureVault with similar projects and technologies, highlighting its strengths, limitations, and key differentiators based on its updated focus: End-to-End Encryption, Device Fingerprinting, and Bot Detection.

| Technology/Project | Purpose | Limitations | Comparison with SecureVault |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| TLS/SSL | Encrypts data in transit between client and server. | \- Encryption stops at Load Balancer or Proxy.\- No device-specific security or bot detection. | \- Complements TLS/SSL by encrypting requests to the application process.\- Adds device fingerprinting and bot detection. |
| mTLS (Mutual TLS) | Adds client-side certificate authentication on top of TLS. | \- Complex certificate management.\- Encryption stops at Proxy or Load Balancer.\- No device fingerprinting or bot detection. | \- Complements mTLS by extending encryption to the application process.\- Adds device fingerprinting and bot detection without certificates. |
| FingerprintJS | Device fingerprinting for bot detection and fraud prevention. | \- Limited to browser environments.\- No encryption or server-side support. | \- Provides cross-platform device fingerprinting (frontend and backend).\- Combines fingerprinting with encryption and bot detection. |
| Cloudflare Bot Management | Protects applications from automated attacks and bots. | \- Requires traffic to route through Cloudflare.\- Limited device-specific controls. \- Paid Service | \- Fully self-hosted with complete control over bot detection.\- Adds E2E encryption and device locking. |
| OAuth2 with PKCE | Secure authentication for public clients using cryptographic secrets. | \- Limited to authentication flows.\- No encryption for general requests.\- No bot detection or device-specific security. | \- Encrypts all requests and responses, not just authentication flows.\- Includes bot detection and device fingerprinting. |
| WebAuthn | Passwordless authentication using public-key cryptography. | \- Limited to authentication use cases.\- No E2E encryption for all requests.\- No bot detection or fingerprinting. | \- Extends encryption beyond authentication.\- Adds bot detection and device locking. |
